# R-package

An R package for optimization and root finding algorithms.

The functions implemented for root finding are Golden Section Search, Brent's method, Newton-Raphson method and Newton-Raphson method which the deravitive given (So the function takes less time to find the root since it does not need to calculate the derivative).

Furthermore Newtons method for optimization is also implemented which finds the minimum point of the given function in an interval. This function is also extended to work with inputs of higher dimension.

Additionally, the package also contains several S3 methods plot, print, summary for each of the functions mentioned above and also contains an R shiny app which can be used to visualise the functions.
